# Excel Data Entry Form

This repository hosts a Python GUI application for an Excel data entry form created using Figma and the **[tkinter Designer](https://github.com/ParthJadhav/Tkinter-Designer)** Python package. This package quickly turns Figma designs into working Python code.

In the linked YouTube video, I show how to change your Figma design into Python code and how to save form data to an Excel file using the **openpyxl** library. I also explain how to make this Python GUI into an executable file with **[PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/)**, so the application can run on computers without Python.
